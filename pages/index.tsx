              I&apos;m <b>Max</b> an independent developer interested in
              technologies involving the web. If you take a look at my projects
              you&apos;ll see that I have a keen interest in learning languages
              and Korean in particular as well.
            </p>

              I&apos;m currently based in Seoul, South Korea. If by any chance
              you are in Korea I&apos;d love to meet you. I already made some
              friends here who, before meeting them here, only knew from
              twitter.

            <p>
              Before coming to Korea I worked for roughly one and a half year in
              Germany in Finance at a big consulting company. Before that I
              majored in Economics and Politics with a special focus on the
              region of East Asia.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides programming I am especially interested in studying (Asian)
              languages. In addition to German and English I am fluent in
              Japanse. Since coming to Korea in the end of February this year I
              intensified my Korean studies and I am currently taking classes at
              Sogang University in Seoul to improve my Korean further.
