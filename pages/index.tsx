            <p>
              Before coming to Korea I worked for roughly one and a half years
              in Germany in Finance at a big consulting company as an audit and
              finance professional. Before that I majored in Economics and
              Politics with a special focus on the region of East Asia.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides programming I am especially interested in studying (Asian)
              languages. In addition to German and English I am fluent in
              Japanse. Since coming to Korea in the end of February in this year
              I intensified my Korean studies as well and am still taking
              language Course at Sogang University in Seoul.
