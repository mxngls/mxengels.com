        "Before coming to Korea I worked for roughly one and a half year in Germany in Finance at a big consulting company. Before that I majored in Economics and Politics with a special focus on the region of East Asia.",
        "Besides programming I am especially interested in studying (Asian) languages. In addition to German and English I am fluent in Japanse. Since coming to Korea in the end of February this year I intensified my Korean studies and I am currently taking classes at Sogang University in Seoul to improve my Korean further."
